### 1. Background
My motivation for doing a sentiment analysis-based project was to familiarize myself with an area of NLP that we haven't really had so much hands-on experience of in the program so far. I also thought it would be interesting and useful to see how one would best go about to extract tweets from Twitter and save them in a data-processing-friendly way. 

Sentiment analysis as such can be viewed as just another form of classification, in it's simplest form a binary classification between "positive" and "negative". However, Wikipedia: "Even though in most statistical classification methods, the neutral class is ignored under the assumption that neutral texts lie near the boundary of the binary classifier, several researchers suggest that, as in every polarity problem, three categories must be identified. Moreover, it can be proven that specific classifiers such as the Max Entropy[9] and SVMs[10] can benefit from the introduction of a neutral class and improve the overall accuracy of the classification."      

Why Twitter?
造 Valuable source of people's opinions and sentiments:
- people might write about products and services they use or express their political and religous views 
造 This can be used for marketing or social studies (Pak & Paroubek 2010)
造 ...

My concerns
I noticed that previous studies (Pak & Paroubek 2010, ...) used emoticons to classify the sentiment of the document. But with the way people write on social media today, does that really reflect the true sentiment of a document? Consider, for instance, a tweet where the smiley face might be used in a mocking manner.  

### 2. Data resource
